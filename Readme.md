# Automated E-commerce Order Processing Workflow

## Project Description

The **Automated E-commerce Order Processing Workflow** project aims to streamline the entire process of e-commerce order handling through an automated and efficient workflow. This system covers everything from order creation to shipment, incorporating various components and services to ensure a seamless process.

## Key Components

1. **Order Creation:** This component either generates mock order data or connects to a sample e-commerce API to simulate the creation of new orders.

2. **Inventory Management:** Before processing an order, this component checks product availability in the inventory. If products are available, it reserves them; otherwise, it handles the situation appropriately.

3. **Order Fulfillment:** Once an order is successful, this component marks it as ready for fulfillment. This includes updating the order status, generating packing slips, and notifying the warehouse team.

4. **Shipping Integration:** If an order is ready for shipment, this component integrates with a shipping service to create shipping labels and track the shipment.

5. **Notification System:** A notification system is implemented to send status updates to customers. It informs them about order processing, shipment, and any potential delays.

## Implementation

1. **Apache Airflow:** The workflow is defined and scheduled using Apache Airflow as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Each step in the workflow is represented as a task in the DAG.

2. **Task Dependencies:** Airflow's dependency management is used, ensuring that tasks are executed in the correct order. For instance, the "Inventory Management" task depends on the successful completion of the "Order Creation" task.

3. **Inventory Monitoring:** Airflow sensors are employed to monitor product availability in the inventory before proceeding with payment processing.

4. **External Service Integration:** Airflow's operators are used to seamlessly integrate with external services, such as payment processing APIs, shipping APIs, and notification services.

5. **Error Handling and Retries:** Each task is equipped with error handling and retry mechanisms, ensuring the system's robustness in the face of unexpected situations.

6. **Monitoring and Alerts:** The Airflow web interface is utilized to monitor the workflow. Alerts are configured to notify relevant parties in case of task failures, allowing swift response and issue resolution.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Apache Airflow installed, along with any required plugins or libraries for API integration.

2. **Configuration:** Configure the project settings, such as API credentials, inventory details, and notification preferences.

3. **Running the Workflow:** Execute the Airflow DAG to start the automated e-commerce order processing workflow.

4. **Monitoring:** Keep an eye on the Airflow web interface for real-time updates on the workflow's progress. Investigate any failures using the provided alerts and logs.
